Jonathan Sauder is a PhD student at the École Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne (EPFL) in Lausanne, Switzerland working on the intersection of 3D computer vision, machine learning and coral reefs. Supervised by Prof. Devis Tuia who leads the ECEO laboratory and Prof. Anders Meibom, head of the LGB laboratory which hosts the Transnational Red Sea Center (TRSC), Jonathan's thesis explores how recent breakthroughs in machine learning and computer vision can be used to create the next generation of coral monitoring tools. During his Master's at the TU Berlin in computer science with a focus on mathematics of machine learning and his Bachelor's at the Hasso Plattner Institute in Potsdam, Jonathan worked on research in the intersection of machine learning, compressed sensing, and computer vision.
